This created a sudden demand for expert fashion history and theory lecturers across the country. As universities scrambled to keep up with the latest haute couture curriculum, they had to offer higher salaries to attract and retain the most fashionable academic talent. So, in a twist no one saw coming, the Sunshine State‚Äôs affinity for style inadvertently elevated the bank accounts of university lecturers nationwide. After all, it‚Äôs not just the students who deserve a well-tailored education!‚Äù Sounds a bit far-fetched, doesn‚Äôt it?\nWhat we‚Äôre seeing here is a classic example of correlation not equaling causation ‚Äî just because two things move together doesn‚Äôt mean one caused the other.\nCausal inference is all about answering the question: What actually causes what? It‚Äôs the science of figuring out how one thing affects another‚Äîwhile carefully separating out confounders, factors that influence both variables and can make their causal relationship look misleading.\nIn the next section, we will look",

    "text": "What is a randomized experiment?\nImagine you want to know whether a teaching method you‚Äôve learned about in GS750 really helps students in your class. You notice that students who took the class with these new implementations seem to get higher scores. But wait ‚Äî maybe those students were already more motivated, or had more free time. How can you tell if it was really the teaching method that caused the improvement?\nTo do this, researchers try to compare groups that are as similar as possible ‚Äî except for the thing they‚Äôre testing (like the new teaching method).\nOne simple (although not always possible) way to do that is a randomized experiment, where individuals are randomly selected into treatment and control groups. Because the assignment is random, the groups are fair, and any difference in outcomes can be attributed to the treatment itself.\n\nFor example, you might randomly assign some students to get the new method (the ‚Äútreatment‚Äù) and others to continue with the old method (the ‚Äúcontrol‚Äù).\n::: {.callout-note appearance=‚Äúsimple‚Äù, collapse=‚Äúfalse‚Äù} ## Definition\nA randomized experiment refers to a scientific study design in which participants are randomly assigned to either a treatment group or a control group. This ensures that any differences in outcomes between the two groups can be attributed solely to the treatment being studied. :::\n\n\nHow can we estimate treatment effect?\nAfter performing a randomized experiment, we can directly compare the two groups by looking at the difference in their average outcomes.\nExample: Suppose a school wants to test whether a new study program improves test scores. They randomly assign 10 students to the new program (Treatment Group) and 10 students to the regular program (Control Group).\n\n\n\nGroup\nTest Scores\n\n\n\n\nTreatment Group\n88, 90, 85, 92, 87, 91, 89, 93, 90, 88\n\n\nControl Group\n80, 82, 78, 85, 81, 79, 83, 84, 82, 80\n\n\n\nStep 1: Calculate the average score\n\nTreatment Group average:\n[ = 89.3 ]\nControl Group average:\n[ = 81.4 ]\n\nStep 2: Compare the averages\nThe difference is:\n[ 89.3 - 81.4 = 7.9 ]\nSince the students were randomly assigned, we can be confident that this difference is caused by the new study program rather than other factors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis gives us a single-number estimate of the difference between the groups. However, we can‚Äôt yet conclude whether this difference is statistically significant. Don‚Äôt worry ‚Äî future statistics classes will teach us how to test that! üôÇ",
