    "text": "What is a randomized experiment?\nImagine you want to know whether a teaching method you‚Äôve learned about in GS750 really helps students in your class. You notice that students who took the class with these new implementations seem to get higher scores. But wait ‚Äî maybe those students were already more motivated, or had more free time. How can you tell if it was really the teaching method that caused the improvement?\nTo do this, researchers try to compare groups that are as similar as possible ‚Äî except for the thing they‚Äôre testing (like the new teaching method).\nOne simple (although not always possible) way to do that is a randomized experiment, where individuals are randomly selected into treatment and control groups. Because the assignment is random, the groups are fair, and any difference in outcomes can be attributed to the treatment itself.\n\nFor example, you might randomly assign some students to get the new method (the ‚Äútreatment‚Äù) and others to continue with the old method (the ‚Äúcontrol‚Äù).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteDefinition\n\n\n\nA randomized experiment refers to a scientific study design in which participants are randomly assigned to either a treatment group or a control group. This ensures that any differences in outcomes between the two groups can be attributed solely to the treatment being studied.\n\n\n\n\nObservational Studies\nWhile randomized experiments are the gold standard for identifying cause-and-effect relationships, they are not always possible. Sometimes it‚Äôs unethical, impractical, or too expensive to assign treatments randomly. In these cases, researchers rely on observational data, where they simply collect information about what naturally happens and look for patterns.\nAn observational study is a type of research where we observe and collect data on people, groups, or things without actively assigning treatments or interventions. Because the groups may differ in ways other than the factor we‚Äôre interested in, it can be harder to tell what actually causes an outcome compared to a randomized experiment.\n\n\nTest yourself\nDrag each scenario to the appropriate box: ‚ÄúRandomized Experiment‚Äù or ‚ÄúObservational Study‚Äù.\nScenarios:\n\nA pharmaceutical company randomly assigns patients to receive either a new drug or a placebo to test its effect on blood pressure.\nA researcher looks people‚Äôs natural coffee-drinking habits and tracks their sleep quality over a month.\nA public health study tracks the diets of different communities and measures heart disease rates without assigning specific diets.\nA school randomly assigns some students to a new math tutoring program and compares their test scores to students in the regular program.\n\n\n  \n    \n    \n      Scenario 1\n      Scenario 2\n      Scenario 3\n      Scenario 4\n    \n\n    \n    \n      \n        Randomized Experiment\n      \n      \n        Observational Study\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n  \n    Check Answers\n    Reset\n  \n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteFood for thought:\n\n\n\n\nRandomized experiments are not the only way to study causality. There are other experimental designs, like quasi-experiments or field experiments, that can help when full randomization isn‚Äôt possible.\nExperiments can have multiple treatments. Sometimes researchers want to compare more than two groups (e.g., different doses of a drug, or several teaching methods).\nThinking about these ideas now will make future lessons on experimental design even more interesting!",
