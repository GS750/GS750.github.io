## Set up

We have already loaded the R packages you need for this tutorial. Once you start working in RStudio, you will run code like the code shown below to load the R packages you need.

```{webr-r}
#| context: setup

library(tidyverse)
library(palmerpenguins)
library(nycflights13)
```

# Exercises

All exercises are from [R for Data Science 2nd Edition](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/).

### [Ex 1 in Section 3.2.5](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/data-transform.html#exercises)

In a single pipeline for each condition, find all flights that meet the condition:

-   Had an arrival delay of two or more hours

-   Flew to Houston (IAH or HOU)

-   Departed in summer (July, August, and September)

-   Arrived more than two hours late but didnâ€™t leave late

```{webr-r}
# Use this code chunk to find flights satisfying the 1st condition
```

<br>

```{webr-r}
# Use this code chunk to find flights satisfying the 2nd condition
```

<br>

```{webr-r}
# Use this code chunk to find flights satisfying the 3rd condition
```

<br>

```{webr-r}
# Use this code chunk to find flights satisfying the 4th condition
```

### [Ex 3 in Section 3.5.7](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/data-transform.html#exercises-2)

How do delays vary over the course of the day? Illustrate your answer with a plot.

```{webr-r}

flights |>
  group_by(____) |> # how to make sure we are looking based on time of the day
  summarize(mean_delay =____) |> # what is the mean delay time for each time of the day
  ggplot(aes(x = _____, y = _____)) + # make a plot
  geom_point()
```

<br>

### [Ex 6 in Section 3.5.7](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/data-transform.html#exercises-2)

Suppose we have the following tiny data frame:



```{webr-r}
#| read-only: true
df <- tibble(
  x = 1:5,
  y = c("a", "b", "a", "a", "b"),
  z = c("K", "K", "L", "L", "K")
)
```

For each of the following, what you think the output will look like? Check if you were correct by running the chunk.

a.

```{webr-r}
#| read-only: true
df |>
  group_by(y)
```

b.

```{webr-r}
#| read-only: true
df |>
  arrange(y)
```

c.

```{webr-r}
#| read-only: true
df |>
  group_by(y) |>
  summarize(mean_x = mean(x))
```

d.

```{webr-r}
#| read-only: true
df |>
  group_by(y, z) |>
  summarize(mean_x = mean(x))
```

e.

```{webr-r}
#| read-only: true
df |>
  group_by(y, z) |>
  summarize(mean_x = mean(x), .groups = "drop")
```

f.

```{webr-r}
#| read-only: true
df |>
  group_by(y, z) |>
  summarize(mean_x = mean(x))
```

g.

```{webr-r}
#| read-only: true
df |>
  group_by(y, z) |>
  mutate(mean_x = mean(x))
```


### Open code chunk

Here is a code chunk in case you wish to play around with some code

```{webr-r}
# your code goes here
```
