## Set up

We have already loaded the R packages you need for this tutorial. Once you start working in RStudio, you will run code like the code shown below to load the R packages you need.

```{webr-r}
#| context: setup

library(tidyverse)
library(palmerpenguins)
library(nycflights13)
```

# Exercises

All exercises are from [R for Data Science 2nd Edition](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/).

### [Ex 1 in Section 12.2.4](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/logicals.html#exercises)
How does `near()` in `dplyr` package work? Type `near` to see the source code. Is `sqrt(2)^2` near `2`?

```{webr-r}
# using equals comaprison
2 == sqrt(2)^2
```

```{webr}
# using near
near(2, sqrt(2)^2)
```

More about floating point comparison can be found in [section 12.2.1](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/logicals.html#sec-fp-comparison).


### [Ex 1 in Section 12.3.4](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/logicals.html#exercises-1)

Find all flights where `arr_delay` is missing but `dep_delay` is not. Find all flights where neither `arr_time` nor `sched_arr_time` are missing, but `arr_delay` is.
