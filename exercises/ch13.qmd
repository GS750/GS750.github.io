## Set up

We have already loaded the R packages you need for this tutorial. Once you start working in RStudio, you will run code like the code shown below to load the R packages you need.

```{webr-r}
#| context: setup

library(tidyverse)
library(palmerpenguins)
library(nycflights13)
```

# Exercises

All exercises are from [R for Data Science 2nd Edition](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/).

### [Ex 3 in Section 13.4.8](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/numbers.html#exercises-1)

Currently `dep_time` and `sched_dep_time` are convenient to look at, but hard to compute with because they’re not really continuous numbers. You can see the basic problem by running the code below: there’s a gap between each hour.

```{webr-r}
#| read-only: true
flights |> 
  filter(month == 1, day == 1) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = sched_dep_time, y = dep_delay)) +
  geom_point()
```

Convert them to a more truthful representation of time (either fractional hours or minutes since midnight).

```{webr-r}
# your code goes here
