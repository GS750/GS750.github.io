## Set up

We have already loaded the R packages you need for this tutorial. Once you start working in RStudio, you will run code like the code shown below to load the R packages you need.

```{webr-r}
#| context: setup

library(tidyverse)
library(palmerpenguins)
library(nycflights13)
```

# Exercises

All exercises are from [R for Data Science 2nd Edition](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/).

### [Ex 3 in Section 17.2.5](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/datetimes.html#exercises)

For each of the following date-times, show how youâ€™d parse it using a readr column specification and a lubridate function (refer to [section 17.2.2](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/datetimes.html#from-strings)).

```{webr-r}
#| read-only: true
d1 <- "January 1, 2010"
d2 <- "2015-Mar-07"
d3 <- "06-Jun-2017"
d4 <- c("August 19 (2015)", "July 1 (2015)")
d5 <- "12/30/14" # Dec 30, 2014
t1 <- "1705"
t2 <- "11:15:10.12 PM"
```

```{webr-r}
# your code goes here

```


### [Ex 3 in Section 17.3.4](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/datetimes.html#exercises-1)

Compare air_time with the duration between the departure and arrival. Explain your findings. (Hint: consider the location of the airport.)

```{webr-r}
