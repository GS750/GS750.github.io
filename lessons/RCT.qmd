# What is a randomized experiment?

Imagine you want to know whether a teaching method you’ve learned about in GS750 really helps students in your class. You notice that students who took the class with these new implementations seem to get higher scores. But wait — maybe those students were already more motivated, or had more free time. How can you tell if it was really the teaching method that caused the improvement?

To do this, researchers try to compare groups that are as similar as possible — except for the thing they’re testing (like the new teaching method).

One simple (although not always possible) way to do that is a **randomized experiment**, where individuals are randomly selected into *treatment* and *control* groups. Because the assignment is random, the groups are fair, and any difference in outcomes can be attributed to the treatment itself.

For example, you might randomly assign some students to get the new method (the "treatment") and others to continue with the old method (the "control").

## Definition

A **randomized experiment** refers to a scientific study design in which participants are randomly assigned to either a treatment group or a control group. This ensures that any differences in outcomes between the two groups can be attributed solely to the treatment being studied.

# Observational Studies

While randomized experiments are the gold standard for identifying cause-and-effect relationships, they are not always possible. Sometimes it’s unethical, impractical, or too expensive to assign treatments randomly. In these cases, researchers rely on observational data, where they simply collect information about what naturally happens and look for patterns.

An **observational study** is a type of research where we observe and collect data on people, groups, or things without actively assigning treatments or interventions. Because the groups may differ in ways other than the factor we’re interested in, it can be harder to tell what actually causes an outcome compared to a randomized experiment.

## Food for thought:

-   Randomized experiments are not the only way to study causality. There are other experimental designs, like quasi-experiments or field experiments, that can help when full randomization isn’t possible.

-   Experiments can have multiple treatments. Sometimes researchers want to compare more than two groups (e.g., different doses of a drug, or several teaching methods).

-   Thinking about these ideas now will make future lessons on experimental design even more interesting!
