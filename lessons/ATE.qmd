# How can we estimate treatment effect?

After performing a randomized experiment, we can **directly compare the two groups** by looking at the difference in their average outcomes.

**Example:** Suppose a school wants to test whether a new study program improves test scores. They randomly assign 10 students to the new program (**Treatment Group**) and 10 students to the regular program (**Control Group**).

| Group             | Test Scores                               |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Treatment Group   | 88, 90, 85, 92, 87, 91, 89, 93, 90, 88   |
| Control Group     | 80, 82, 78, 85, 81, 79, 83, 84, 82, 80   |

**Step 1: Calculate the average score**

- **Treatment Group average:**  
$$\frac{88 + 90 + 85 + 92 + 87 + 91 + 89 + 93 + 90 + 88}{10} = 89.3$$

- **Control Group average:**  
$$
\frac{80 + 82 + 78 + 85 + 81 + 79 + 83 + 84 + 82 + 80}{10} = 81.4
$$

**Step 2: Compare the averages**

The difference is:  
$89.3 - 81.4 = 7.9 \text{ points}$

Since the students were randomly assigned, we can be confident that this difference is **caused by the new study program** rather than other factors.

This gives us a single-number estimate of the difference between the groups. However, **we canâ€™t yet conclude whether this difference is statistically significant**. Donâ€™t worry â€” future statistics classes will teach us how to test that! ðŸ™‚
