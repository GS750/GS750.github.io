## 🌱 Summary

In this lesson, you learned:

- **What causal inference is** — the science of figuring out what causes what and separating true effects from confounding relationships.  
- **What a randomized experiment is** — a study design where participants are randomly assigned to treatment and control groups, allowing us to make causal claims.
- **How to estimate a treatment effect** — by comparing the average outcomes of the two groups.  
- **That not all data comes from experiments** — sometimes we rely on observational studies, where we observe what happens naturally rather than assigning treatments ourselves.

## 🔍 Key Takeaways

- Randomization helps ensure that differences between groups are due to the treatment, not preexisting factors.  
- The difference in group averages gives us a first look at the treatment effect — but future lessons will help us decide whether the difference is statistically significant.  
- Experiments aren’t always possible — sometimes for ethical, practical, or cost reasons — and that’s where observational data becomes essential.

## 🚀 What’s Next

In the next section, we’ll move beyond simple comparisons and start exploring:
 
- How the **design of the experiment** can be improved.
- How to handle data from **observational studies**.   
- How to begin thinking about **confounders** and **adjustment**.
