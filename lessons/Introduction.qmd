## What is Causal Inference

Imagine you want to know whether a teaching method you've learned about in GS750 really helps students in your class. You notice that students who took the class with these new implementations seem to get higher scores. But wait â€” maybe those students were already more motivated, or had more free time. How can you tell if it was really the teaching method that caused the improvement?

**Causal inference** is all about answering that kind of question: *What actually causes what?* Itâ€™s the science of figuring out the effect of one thing on another.

Consider the following plot[^1]:
